A vanilla survival experience, with claims. We at MinecraftGolden are very busy with expanding our current survival gamemode into an all-new, exclusive to MinecraftGolden experience with many customized features, and a variety of entertaining settings. While we are busy with this however, the vanilla survival experience is the only one we are currently able to offer.
